    <h2 class="rivertitle">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
    <p class="para">
      Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon
      river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No
      Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that
      came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that
      they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the
      river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river
      corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over
      the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
      when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The
      Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
      free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early
      summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good
      rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to
      appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

    <h2 class="rivertitle">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
    <p class="para">
      Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land
      anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the
      sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids
      have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to
      Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
      scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
      historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is
      rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days Desolation Canyon has
      been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
      uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

    <h2 class="rivertitle">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
    <p class="para">
      This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river
      trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon
      river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to
      make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not
      only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and
      ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand
      Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
      technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of
      rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the
      regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
